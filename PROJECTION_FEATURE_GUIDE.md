## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Limitations
- **Not financial advice**: For educational/research purposes only
- **Historical data based**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
- **Market volatility**: Unexpected events can invalidate projections
- **Short-term focus**: Most accurate for 1-15 day projections

### Best Practices
1. **Use multiple methods**: Don't rely on single projection
2. **Consider market context**: Factor in news, earnings, market conditions
3. **Set stop losses**: Always have risk management in place
4. **Regular updates**: Re-run analysis as new data becomes available
5. **Combine with fundamentals**: Use alongside fundamental analysis

### Technical Requirements
- **Internet connection**: Required for real-time data
- **Modern browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Python dependencies**: All automatically installed via requirements.txt

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Could not fetch data"**: Check stock symbol format (use NSE symbols without .NS)
2. **"Projection chart failed"**: Ensure stable internet connection
3. **Slow performance**: Try reducing projection days or fewer methods
4. **Missing indicators**: Some stocks may have insufficient historical data

### Performance Tips
- **Start with 7-15 days**: Good balance of accuracy and speed
